## Instructions

Assume the questions and answers file has been 'provided' already and is stored locally (create this yourself in a format of your choice).

## Notes

Submission and verification of answers should be done with JavaScript to avoid unnecessary page loads.

Read the bonus section below. You do not need to support this in your solution, but it's worth bearing in mind when you consider your design.

## Bonus section

How would you support different types of question? For example, some questions might:

- have more than one possible answer e.g. Name a US state capital
- require multiple answers - e.g. Name two of the six members of Monty Python.
